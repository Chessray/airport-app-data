# Virgin Atlantic ~ Flight Information Display

A quick demo for an airport information display based on CSV input. 

## Build & Run

The project uses the Gradle wrapper. The only requirement is a JDK (minimum 17).

Build the project with `./gradlew build`.

Start the application with `./gradlew run`.

## Usage

The command line interaction asks you for a date (split into year, month and date within that month). It will then display the flight table for that date and exit.
